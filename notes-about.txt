  Systematically creative.
  Creative systems.

  Born and raised in Sweden

  gÃ¶r det personligt. detska upplevas trevligt.

  systems and creativity
  
  - system: rubics cube, finance, accounting, maths, organization, project management
  - creativity: music, code
  - swimming, snowboard



  My personality is maybe best explained with this comic: <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png">Nerd Sniping</a> (as the person being sniped, not the sniper)

  I am at most alive when fully engaged in solving a problem. Anything from rubics cube to learning an instrument or get up properly on a surf board counts. Interesting problems tend to show up everywhere.

  I happen to like software and music in particular because they are ubiquitous. They're (usually) easy to carry around and possible to practice both alone and with others.

  I'm an outgoing introvert, a calculated risktaker, an exploration junkie and incurably competitive on the inside.





  I tend to reduce everything to a system.

  Time is not an issue.

  Early on, I dicovered that there are interesting problems in every field imaginable.
  Apart from computers:
  - Rubics cube
  - Snowboarding
  - Swimming really fast
  - Exercising optimally
  - Team effectiveness
  - Law
  - Music

  The full experience of life.
  
  I like life best when
  
  I don't live to work. I just happen to have a lot of fun doing some of this "work".
  
  I currently live in Stockholm, Sweden.
