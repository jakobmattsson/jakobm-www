I just gave a [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/jakobmattsson/how-to-star-actually-star-use-promises-in-javascript) at [sthlm.js](http://www.meetup.com/sthlm-js/), about JavaScript promises and my library [Z](https://github.com/jakobmattsson/z-core). You can find all of the content in the links.

As usual I ran a quick survey by the end. In the name of openness, self-improvement and hopefully as inspiration to others, I'll write a little about my learnings here.

I got 38 responses (out of about 100 I'd say), which is good! A vast majority were positive and rated the talk high. There were some clear opinions on improvements though, which is the really interesting part.

Quickly, on the positive side, words like the following were the most common: "energy, pace, well presented, focused, deliverance, high level, clear goal, dynamism, style, progression, code, humor, positive, honest". I'd summarize those things as (1) well-prepared and (2) well-presented.

On the negative side the gist was something like this: "explicatives, live coding, more error handling, slow down, invert colors, a little cocky, assumed people knew much, better projector, less code." I think of these as three different classes of feedback.

The first class are hard to address. "More error handling" and "Assumed people knew much" are clear trade-offs against values that were also rated as positive. I intentionally left the error handling out (despite comments from my co-workers) due to the already info packed talk. And in the same spirit, it would be hard to give this talk without assumptions about peoples knowledge. It's impossible to cater to everyone and this time I chose to give a talk that was a bit advanced. I still listen to this though and I'll see if some changes could improve it without compromising the good parts.

The second class where color invertion, projector quality and avoiding the live coding (I guess it took too much time). Those are some things that I can easily adjust until next time. No biggies. Thanks for letting me know!

The third class are the ones I really take to my heart and will really spend time on changing. The explicatives, the fast talking and the slight cockyness are what I'm thinking about. I often get very engaged while speaking, which easily leads to speaking too fast. Especially when there's a lot of ground to cover. I'll try some tricks next time and really halt myself.

Regarding the explicatives and the cockyness, I get a bad feeling just reading it. I can imagine how it must have sounded. To quote one comment: "the first 'fuck' may be funny, but the next 10 ones are forced." A wrote a few of these into the actual slides, but it must have affected my language beyond that. Just as the commenter pointed out, one or two scripted are ok, but it's not ok to go on an unprofessional ranting rampage. It came as quite a surprise to me (I guess I couldn't hear it myself), but it also came as a total turnoff and something I will very much avoid next time around.

I very much appreciate all the feedback and will use it to improve this and future talks that I'll give. Thanks sthlm.js, you're great!
