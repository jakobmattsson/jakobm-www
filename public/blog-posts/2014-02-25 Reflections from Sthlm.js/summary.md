I just gave a [talk](https://speakerdeck.com/jakobmattsson/how-to-star-actually-star-use-promises-in-javascript) at [sthlm.js](http://www.meetup.com/sthlm-js/), about JavaScript promises and my library [Z](https://github.com/jakobmattsson/z-core). You can find all of the content in the links.

As usual I ran a quick survey by the end. In the name of openness, self-improvement and hopefully as inspiration to others, I'll write a little about my learnings here.
