      <p>Building things is what I do. Mostly for employers or as open source, but sometimes as a freelancer.</p>
      <p>I like to be generalist when it comes to technologies and methods, but I do have a special affection for JavaScript and test-driven development.</p>

        <p>As a developer Jakob shows great enthusiasm and passion. A hard-working and impressive problem solver, he's great at exploring how to leverage new as well as established tools, technologies and architectures. He is humble and listens carefully to others, but doesn't hesitate to voice his own opinions.</p>

        <p>Jakob is a master of his trade. He's skilled in every part of the web development chain, from writing code and architecting software to setting up processes that make it easy to get quality work done. He's not only great himself, he makes everyone around him better.</p>

        <p>Jakob is one of the best (and fastest) programmers I've ever worked with. He's not the oh-so-common "head-down" type of programmer, he actually enjoys working with the problem at hand and making it better through collaboration and iteration. On top of that he can manage a team with no problem. Creative, ambitious and someone I wouldn't hesitate to work with again. I really hope we do.</p>

      <h1>My story</h1>
      <img src="/img/jakob-face.jpg">
      <p>Jigsaw puzzles, lego and then code. I've always been building things and it's still my main idea of fun.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy challenges just for the sake of it, be it intellectual, creative or physical. Playing the guitar, speed-solving Rubics cube, snowboarding and swimming are some of my other hobbies.</p>
      <p>I've mainly worked in small, intense and energetic companies, as developer and manager. Most notably at the companies below.</p>
      <ul class="mini-cv">
