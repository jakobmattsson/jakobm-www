      <p>Building things is what I do. Mostly for employers or as open source, but sometimes as a freelancer.</p>

      <p>My speciality is in large scale web and mobile. I've worked for several startups and even started a few, so I speak both code and business. I know what to look for.</p>

      <p>People either love me or hate me. Or they think I'm OK. Regardless, I believe in sharing.</p>

        <p>Funny, interesting, to the point and relevant.</p>
        <p>Everything was well summarized. Good readibility of the slides.</p>

        <p>Very well structured, easy to follow. Nice and simple slides.</p>
        <p>Good public speaking skills, I had fun!</p>

      <h1>My story</h1>
      <img src="/img/jakob-face.jpg">
      <p>Jigsaw puzzles, lego and then code. I've always been building things and it's still my main idea of fun.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy challenges just for the sake of it, be it intellectual, creative or physical. Playing the guitar, speed-solving Rubics cube, snowboarding and swimming are some of my other hobbies.</p>
      <p>I've mainly worked in small, intense and energetic companies, as developer and development manager. Most notably at the companies below.</p>
      <ul class="mini-cv">
        <li>
          <b>FishBrain &mdash;</b> Hired as CTO, I'm currently working to build a kick-ass team as well as a kick-ass product out of Stockholm, Sweden.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Touch&amp;Tell &mdash;</b> As one of the co-founders, I worked with everything from coding to sales and eventually hired me out of it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Burt &mdash;</b> Big data, extreme JavaScript and a highly distributed system - I started by building cool stuff and ended up as VP of Engineering.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CTK &mdash;</b> Consultant in four different projects, consultant manager and eventually CEO; I did it all and moved on when we were 60 employees.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find me all over the internet. I try to be the most active in the following places.</p>
