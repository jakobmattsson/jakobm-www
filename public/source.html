      <p>People either love me or hate me. Or they think I'm OK. Regardless, I believe in sharing.</p>
      <p>When on stage, I prefer to entertain and give concrete inspiration rather than verbal manuals and documentation.</p>

        <p>Funny, interesting, to the point and relevant.</p>
        <p>Everything was well summarized. Good readibility of the slides.</p>

        <p>Very well structured, easy to follow. Nice and simple slides.</p>

      <h1>My story</h1>
      <img src="/img/jakob-face.jpg">
      <p>Jigsaw puzzles, lego and then code. I've always been building things and it's still my main idea of fun.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy challenges just for the sake of it, be it intellectual, creative or physical. Playing the guitar, speed-solving Rubics cube, snowboarding and swimming are some of my other hobbies.</p>
      <p>I've mainly worked in small, intense and energetic companies, as developer and manager. Most notably at the companies below.</p>
      <ul class="mini-cv">
